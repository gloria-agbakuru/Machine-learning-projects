Welcome to my repository of Machine Learning projects! This collection includes various analysis and prediction models built using Python and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. The projects cover topics such as disaster prediction, loan prediction, and sales forecasting. All projects are implemented in Jupyter Notebooks for easy understanding and experimentation. Feel free to explore and run the notebooks to see the models in action!
